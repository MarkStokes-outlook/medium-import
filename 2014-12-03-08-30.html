                    This weekend I was delighted to present a new session on the SharePoint Geolocation field.  It was a great interactive session with lots of input, comments and suggestions from the audience.
                </p>
                <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
There are a great many uses for the geolocation field and we are getting more and more used to adding location information to our content to get additional dynamics on our data.
                </p>
                <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
This session runs you through the requirements to enable the Geolocation field in your environments (with the code to do so) and also runs through setting up the field on a list, adding data and viewing the Map information.

<h2>Sample Code</h2>
During my session I used a "test harness" that contained the code for:
<ul>
<li>Setting and retrieving the Bing Maps key on an SPWeb</li>
<li>Adding the Geolocation Field to a list</li>
<li>Importing CSV data to a list</li>
</ul>
This code is adapted /extended from a blog post i found by a guy called Borislav GrgiÄ‡ and the original source can be found here.
                 </p>
                <p class="pw-post-body-paragraph">
This code has a reliance on JQuery, you know where to get that from! and also JQuery CSV.
